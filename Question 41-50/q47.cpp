/*Histogram problems involve analyzing bars (rectangles) representing values such as frequencies or areas. A common problem is finding the largest rectangle that can fit under the histogram. These problems have applications in areas like image processing, computational geometry, data visualization, and optimization tasks. Efficient algorithms are used for tasks like calculating the largest area, detecting significant changes in data, and solving range queries.*/
