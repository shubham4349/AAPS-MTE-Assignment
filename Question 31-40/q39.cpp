/*Subsets and permutations are both ways of selecting elements from a set, but they differ in the importance of order.
Subsets are combinations of elements where the order does not matter.
For example, for the set {1, 2, 3}, the subsets include {1}, {2}, {1, 2}, etc.
Permutations, however, involve arranging elements in a specific order, and different orderings of the same elements count as distinct.
For the set {1, 2, 3}, the permutations include (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), etc.
In short, subsets focus on combinations without order, while permutations focus on ordered arrangements.*/
