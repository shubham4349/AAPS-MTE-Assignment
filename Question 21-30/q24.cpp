Bit Manipulation in C++
Bit manipulation is the process of directly manipulating bits (0s and 1s) of numbers using bitwise operators. This technique allows you to perform operations on individual bits rather than the entire number, making certain algorithms much faster and more memory-efficient.
Common Bitwise Operators
AND (&): Returns 1 only if both bits are 1. Example: 5 & 3 = 1
OR (|): Returns 1 if at least one bit is 1. Example: 5 | 3 = 7
XOR (^): Returns 1 if the bits are different. Example: 5 ^ 3 = 6
NOT (~): Flips all the bits. Example: ~5 = -6
Left Shift (<<): Shifts bits to the left (multiply by 2). Example: 5 << 1 = 10
Right Shift (>>): Shifts bits to the right (divide by 2). Example: 5 >> 1 = 2
Advantages of Bit Manipulation
Speed: Bitwise operations are very fast, often requiring just one machine cycle.
Space Efficiency: Using bit manipulation, we can represent and store large amounts of data efficiently, saving memory.
Compact Code: Bit manipulation often allows us to solve problems in fewer lines of code.
